/* Purpose: Debouncing prevents a function from being called
too frequently by delaying its execution until a period of inactivity
 
Methods: You can use libraries like Lodash or create custum debounce hooks
 
Usage: Ideal for input fields, window resize events, or any scenario with
 rapid fire events
